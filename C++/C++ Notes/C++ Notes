Modularity can be acheived by practicing these below given way for example.

3 files:
abc.h        -> only function declarations -> also can be called as interface
abc.c        -> defination of all the function present in abc.h
abc_client.c -> using the above functions as needed by the client.


Static keyword: Used while function declaration & function defination enables the function call of that function only in the file where it is defined & can't be called outside the file where it is defined.
Used in the server side in case of above example server code.
